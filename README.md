## How to Use
<ol type="1">
					<li><strong>Choose a Candidate or Custom Mode</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>'Custom' is the default mode. It allows you to click a
								state and set customized results first and foremost.</li>
							<li>Selecting a candidate allows you to click a state and
								conveniently set your candidate in the lead.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Select a State and Experiment with Results</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Experiment with a state's statewide results by managing
								percentage points representing the popular vote.</li>
							<li>Unallocated and available percentage points are always
								displayed. Remove points from candidates to give yourself
								a basket of points to use.</li>
							<li>Make use of the 'Custom' mode when diving deep into numerous
								state results. It helps avoid mistakenly overriding already
								modified states with a 'Candidate' click.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Count the Delegates</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Click 'Count Delegates' to calculate and display the share of
								delegates candidates have recieved exclusively from already customized
								state results (dyed states).</li>
							<li>Hovering over a slice of the donut chart reveals a candidate's overall
								percentage of pledged delegates nationwide as well as their current
								delegate count.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
