## Live Demo
[PrimaryDraft.com](http://www.PrimaryDraft.com) - Deployed with AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

The common flow includes picking a candidate or using the 'Custom' option, clicking states you'd like your selected candidate to be ahead in represented by a unique color, select individual states to manipulate the popular vote and allocate delegates, and then view a pie chart representing the total delegate count of current states in play with more information on hover. Then you can go back and keep experimenting with different results!
